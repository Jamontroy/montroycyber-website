                        Unfortunately due to the unexpected passing of my grandfather, I only had about 8 hours to work on the competition. For what I had, I am quite satisfied with 1000+ points.

                        I am really proud of the competition. It was held locally and I got paired in a team with two people who I had never met before. Despite this, as a group of three underclassman we managed to finish 4th among groups of 6 people.
